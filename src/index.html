          <h3>Wellington Central</h3>
          <p class="description">
            At the <a href="#">centre of New Zealand</a> you’ll find Wellington, a region with so much to offer.
            Nestled between green hills and a sparkling harbour, the city is full of things just waiting to be
            discovered.
          </p>
          <h3>Culture & Museums</h3>
          <p class="description">
            Packed with national treasures, Wellington's <a href="#">museums</a> tell the stories of New Zealand's past.
            Right on the
            waterfront, you'll find Te Papa Tongarewa, the most visited museum in Oceania. Here, six stories of
            exhibitions showcase aspects of the country's diverse art and visual culture.
          </p>
          <h3>Gastronomy & breweries</h3>
          <p class="description">
            Wellington’s reputation as New Zealand’s culinary capital is well-deserved: it has more eateries and bars
            per capita than New York City. Wellington is famous for its tucked-away bars, café culture, award-winning
            <a href="#">restaurants</a> and bars, and great coffee. Head to Courtenay Place or Cuba Street to get
            amongst the good
            stuff.
          </p>
          <h3>Nature</h3>
          <p class="description">
            Immerse yourself in <a href="#">nature</a> and explore by bike, foot, kayak, or ferry. Relax at Oriental
            Bay, Wellington's
            golden-sand inner-city beach, before walking the Southern Walkway trail to Wellington's rugged south coast.
            Venture north to explore the Remutaka Cycle Trail, one of New Zealand’s Great Rides, or the Escarpment
            Track, where you can experience spectacular views of the Kāpiti Coast as you scale steep steps, ridgelines,
            and swing bridges.
